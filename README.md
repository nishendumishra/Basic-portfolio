# Basic-portfolio
This is a basic Portfolio which I created in the beginning of my learning of HTML and CSS. It contain basic HTML and CSS.

# Body
In the Body section, there are three containers namely top-container, middle-container and bottom-container.

# top-container
In the top container I have put the images of cloud and mountain to give a beautiful look.

# middle-container
In the middle container, introduction skills and contact me tabs are given.
Whenever someone clicks on the Contact me tab , he goes to mail , then the user can mail the message to my mail.

# bottom-container
There you can find links to my different social media handles. People can get in contact using social media handles also.
